# Social Media App

This is the frontend part of a Single Page Application I developed as part of the Frontend Training Center at Coherent Solutions.

This project is done in HTML, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript, but with a heavy accent on JavaScript. 
The purpose was building a Social Media App in vanilla JS using OOP, with emphasis on Single Responsibility Principle and code reusability. 

It required implementing client side rendering by creating a custom Router with a template renderer, saving user data (strings and images) in local storage, and later refactoring for MongoDB. The project also required developing a RESTful API in Node.js with CRUD operations, using Mongoose to model the application data. Version control done through Bitbucket using Git.

create an html page with only layout
    header
        we can put whatever we want, but the important part is the layout
    footer
        sticky footer
    3 columns in the middle of page
        left column will be used for additional menu
        middle columns should be a big one which contains all the content
        right column will be used for advertisement
        add different backgrounds for each columns and no gaps between columns

3 css files
    easiest will be using flexbox
    then with display inline block
    last one only floats
    don't set column height in pixels
    in the future we will work only in flex variants

We should write that we are done. Everytime we are ready with the task, we will share screen and see the code.
If you have questions, we can write them on the common chat.

Flexbox vs. Grid vs. Blocks layouts
    - use flexbox or grid for main layout but use simpler methods for small arrangements
    e.g.: icons set to display inline block instead of flexbox

semantic html
    - needed for SEO
    e.g.: for navbar the use of links are used for SEO

use css class names modifiers
    e.g.: 'section menu' becomes 'section section-menu'

avoid using calc() if possible
